Still to program:

netlog.q
users.q
tp.q
rdb.q
hdb.q


shutdown.q



first 3 must be in that order as tp.q requires netlog and users library to be loaded


ADD IN WHAT EACH SCRIPT DOES AND HOW IT WORKS - HOW EACH SCRIPT WORKS ETC

ADD DEPENDANCY TREE IN HERE - Obvs only some scripts need to be started - some are only libraruies - define which ones are depended on, and which must be run and in which order, - Will help program the shutdown.q script
